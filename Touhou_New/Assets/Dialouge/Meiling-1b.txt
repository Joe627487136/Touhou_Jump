Meiling: Ugh. You're being very aggressive today. 
Reimu: Sorry, but I have to make this quick. 
Meiling: Alright then, but she's not in the Mansion right now though.
Reimu: What? Why didn't you tell me earlier!?
Meiling: You didn't ask. She went out a little while ago. 
Reimu: Argh! Do you know where she's going?
Meiling: Not really, but they were headed towards the human village though. 
Reimu: That's good enough. See you at booze night then. 
Meiling: I'll be there.
