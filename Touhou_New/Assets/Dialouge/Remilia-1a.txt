Reimu: Hey, come out! I know you're here.
Remilia: It's so noisy here. Such a ruckus. What do you want?
Reimu: Simple. To defeat you.
Remilia: What a random purpose!
Remilia: Really. I don't understand why we should fight now. 
Reimu: Oh, I do. The thing you know, that thing.
Remilia: That thing? You mean when you suddenly appear at my mansion...
Remilia: ...Get beaten enough, and return home depressed? 
Remilia: That's surely none of my business.
Reimu: Well, its that thing you know. And you are always plotting something after all. 
Remilia: Perhaps so, but what does it have to do with that thing?
Reimu: As I thought. Its that thing. I have to defeat you.
Remilia: Were you even listening? What thing? You are acting oddly more aggresive than usual. 
Reimu: Enough talk. After I defeat you, the thing will be clear!
Remilia: What is going on here?
