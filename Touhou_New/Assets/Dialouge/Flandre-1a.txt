Reimu: Stop Flandre!
Flandre: Hmm?
Reimu: What are you doing here? And where's you're sister?
Flandre: Sis? She went to the shrine. 
Flandre: She let me play here, but the toys break so easily.  
Flandre: But you look fun. 
Flandre: Do you want to play with me? 
Reimu: The shrine? Why's she going there? 
Flandre: Play with me.
Reimu: Anyways, stop terrorising the villages. I still need them for donations. 
Flandre: Play with me. 
Reimu: H-hey, are you okay?
Flandre: Play with me, shrine lady. 
Reimu: Uh.
Flandre: PLAY WITH ME. PLAY WITH ME. PLAY WITH ME.
Reimu: Gah!? Crazy girl. 
Reimu: A good spanking it is then.
