Reimu: Now then! I know what you were plotting. You want to destroy the shrine and take over the Gensokyo!
Remilia: What are you talking about? The thing? That thing? I don't know what are you referring to. 
Reimu: Oh, you don't?
Remilia: I just came here for Marisa. She stole Patchouli's books from our mansion's library!
Remilia: Uncouth as you may be, you're not usually this rude.
Reimu: I'm off then and go take Marisa. She is inside the second room playing home console.
Remilia: What?
Remilia: Wait! 
Remilia: ...
Remilia: What just happened and you just beat me and go off?! Hey!!!
